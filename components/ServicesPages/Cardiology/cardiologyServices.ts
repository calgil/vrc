  {
    title: "Echocardiography (Echo)",
    content: `This is an ultrasound of the heart that allows the Cardiologist to visualize your pet’s heart structure and function while it beats. It aids in the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of many heart conditions.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG)",
    content: `This is a non-invasive method used to detect abnormal electrical activity of the heart (arrhythmia) that may be present. Arrhythmia may not always result in symptoms at home or be detected on a routine physical exam.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Holter Monitoring",
    content: `Holter monitors are wearable devices that may be placed on your pet to evaluate for the presence of intermittent arrhythmia or to monitor the success of treatment of an arrhythmia. The device requires small patches of hair to be shaved from your pet’s chest where electrode stickers are placed. The electrodes are connected to a monitoring pack that is secured with a vest. Typically, the monitor is worn for 24 hours.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Digital Thoracic Radiographs (Chest X-rays)",
    content: `X-rays of the chest are an important tool to appropriately diagnose, assess, and monitor many cardiac conditions, particularly congestive heart failure.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Blood Work",
    content: `Many blood tests are available for the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiac disease. These tests will be discussed at the time of your appointment and can be performed with our Cardiology team.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Direct care of hospitalized emergency cardiac patients",
    content: `Many cardiac diseases can be life threatening and need urgent attention. Our Emergency team is available for your urgent cardiac needs 24-7. Our Cardiologist will be actively involved in the care of your pet during their stay in the hospital with us. They will receive gold standard medical care and monitoring with wireless continuous electrocardiogram monitoring (telemetry), oxygen support with temperature and humidity-controlled kennels, and 24-7 nursing care`,
  },
  {
    title: "Nurse visits",
    content: `Most cardiac diseases require follow-up tests over time to adequately control symptoms and extend their quality of life. Our experienced cardiac nurses are here for your routine blood work visits, Holter monitor placements, electrocardiogram monitoring, blood pressure measurements and much more. These visits are reserved for pets that have already met with the Cardiologist for an initial consultation, and are feeling well but are coming in for routine testing and monitoring.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Abdominocentesis and Thoracocentesis",
    content: `These procedures involve using a needle or catheter to remove free fluid from within the abdomen (abdominocentesis) or chest (thoracocentesis). Accumulation of fluid in the body cavities can occur with certain types of congestive heart failure and causes discomfort and difficulty breathing.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Agitated saline contrast studies",
    content: `Some complex cardiac diseases cannot be definitively diagnosed with echocardiography alone. This test involves agitating sterile saline and injecting it into a vein while watching with the ultrasound. By visualizing the path that the saline takes within the heart and vessels, the Cardiology team can make a more targeted diagnosis and treatment plan.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Phlebotomy",
    content: `Certain cardiac diseases result in inappropriately high levels of red blood cells. This procedure involves removing blood from a vein in the neck and replacing it with saline to help reduce symptoms and complications associated with the high red blood cell counts.`,
  },
  {
    title: "OFA/Pre-breed Screenings",
    content: `These appointments are for pets that are healthy with no known heart murmur, arrhythmia, or heart disease for the purpose of being screened prior to breeding or getting cardiac clearance with OFA`,
  },
  {
    title: "Minimally Invasive Catheter Procedures",
    content: `Catheter based surgical procedures are used for treatment of common congenital heart diseases such as a patent ductus arteriosus, and pulmonic stenosis, as well as pacemaker implantation, and heartworm removal.`,
