    bio: "Dr. Kellie Barreto is originally from Miami, Florida. She attended both Florida International University and Florida State University, earning a bachelor degree in Health Sciences and Biological Sciences, respectively. After spending some time in France, she was accepted into the University of Glasgow School of Veterinary Medicine in Scotland, home to one of the most advanced small animal hospitals in Europe and rivaling any in the world. She graduated with her BVMS veterinary degree in 2013 and is eligible to practice veterinary medicine worldwide, as Glasgow vet school is accredited by American, UK, European, and Australian standards. Dr. Barreto is also a member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.\n\nAfter graduation from veterinary school, Dr. Barreto completed a one-year rotating internship in small animal medicine and surgery at the Veterinary Emergency Clinic and Referral Center in Toronto, Ontario, Canada; a one-year specialty internship focusing on small animal internal medicine and critical care at Gulf Coast Veterinary Specialists in Houston, Texas; and a 3-year residency in internal medicine beginning at the Animal Specialty Center in Yonkers, NYâ€”ending at the Animal Medical Center in Manhattan, NY in 2018.\n\nIn 2019, she passed the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine board exams. She practiced at a multi-specialty and emergency referral hospital in Colorado for several years prior to joining North Springs in 2023.\n\nWhile she enjoys all aspects of internal medicine, she has a particular interest in immune-mediated hematological disorders, gastrointestinal disease, renal disease, endoscopy, and abdominal ultrasonography.\n\nDr. Barreto genuinely enjoys being part of a team where clinical expertise is shared, and a broad-minded, yet practical, approach to different treatment methods is emphasized. She has a firm commitment to a high standard of animal welfare and believes in taking a compassionate and empathetic approach when treating patients and communicating with clients and colleagues in the referring community. Her overall goal is to build a partnership with each individual client that is based on shared decision-making, allowing them to take a more active role as an equal contributor when it comes to the medical care of their pet.\n\nIn her spare time, Dr. Barreto enjoys hiking, kayaking, camping, photography, fishing, and via ferrata climbing. She has a cat named Joon and a Catahoula named Buster.",
